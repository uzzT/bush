semantically accurate

Whenever possible, use a single domain & subdomain

The more readable by human beings, the better

Keywords in URLs: still a good thing

Multiple URLs serving the same content? Canonicalize 'em!

Exclude dynamic parameters when possible

If you can avoid using URL parameters, do so. If you have more than two URL parameters, it's probably worth making a serious investment to rewrite them as static, readable, text.

Shorter > longer

Match URLs to titles most of the time (when it makes sense)

Remove/control for unwieldy punctuation characters 移除笨重的标点符号字符

Limit redirection hops to two or fewer

Fewer folders is generally better

Avoid hashes in URLs that create separate/unique content

Keyword stuffing and repetition are pointless and make your site look spammy 垃圾连接
